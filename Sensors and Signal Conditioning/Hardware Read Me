#Hardware Designs
This lab an Analog Digital Converter to read from a sensor. The sensors, a photoresistor and phototransistor, used special hardware to change their outputs to a corrosponding voltage. The photo resistor changed its resistance based on light. To create a corrosponding voltage from this sensor, a voltage divider circuit was created. This can be seen in the simulation below

This simulation shows both the circuit diagram and a typical output voltage. The during testing, the photoresistor
